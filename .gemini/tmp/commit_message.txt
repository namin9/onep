feat: Implement core game systems and update test client

This commit introduces significant progress in the "Archive Editor" idle game development by implementing key GDD layers and enhancing the test client.

- **Backend (worker-api):**
  - Implemented initial `handleGameProgress` logic for idle rewards.
  - Designed and implemented "Library" system (Layer 3):
    - Added `Monsters` and `User_Monster_Fragments` tables to `gdd/database/schema.sql`.
    - Created `library.ts` handler with `handleGetCodex` and `handleSubmitFragments`.
    - Integrated Library routes (`/api/library/codex`, `/api/library/submit_fragments`).
  - Designed and implemented "Soul" system (Layer 4):
    - Added `soul_essence` to `User_Stats` and new `Talents`, `User_Talents` tables to `gdd/database/schema.sql`.
    - Created `soul.ts` handler with `handleRebirth`, `handleUnlockTalent`, and `handleGetTalentTree`.
    - Integrated Soul routes (`/api/soul/rebirth`, `/api/soul/unlock_talent`, `/api/soul/talents`).
  - Confirmed existing robust implementations for `handleUpgradeStat` and `handleGachaPull`.
  - Ensured `wrangler.toml` is configured for `archive-editor-db`.

- **Frontend (client-test):**
  - Overhauled `index.html` and `main.js` to create a comprehensive API test harness.
  - Added UI and logic for Login, User Stats display, Game Progress, Stat Upgrades, Gacha Pulls.
  - Integrated UI and logic for new Library features (Get Codex, Submit Fragments).
  - Integrated UI and logic for new Soul features (Rebirth, Unlock Talent, Get Talent Tree).

This allows for end-to-end testing of all core game mechanics implemented so far.
